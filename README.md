## 👋 Hi, I'm Shravani V

## About:
<p>
I'm a backend developer passionate about building reliable, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.<br />

I have experience working with microservices, message queues (like RabbitMQ), RESTful APIs, and containerized deployments using Docker.<br />

I enjoy clean architecture, well-tested code, and tackling performance bottlenecks. Currently, I'm diving deeper into distributed systems and async processing.<br />

I'm always curious, always learning, and open to collaborating on exciting projects — especially in fast-paced, tech-forward environments<br />
</p>
